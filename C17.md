### Environment

- a source file, with headers and sources included via `#include`, is called _preprocessing translation unit_. After preprocessing, it is called _translation unit_
- a source file that is not empty shall end in a newline character which shall not be immediately preceded by a backslash character
- in freestanding environment, C program executes without any benefit of an operating system (except minimal set in clause 4) and the name/type of a function is called at startup is implementation-defined
- in a hosted environment
  - startup function is `main` with return type `int` and with no parameters or two named `argc`/`argv`
  ```c
  int main() {}
  int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {} // argc is non-negative, argv[0] is program name if exist <- both are modifiable
  ```
  - return of `main` is equivalent to calling `exit` with the same value if its return type is int-compatible and reach `}` is equivalent to `return 0`
- integer/double-precision promotion promote each operand to `int/double` then do the operator and truncate afterward, but the actual execution need only produce the same result, possibly omitting the promotion
  ```c
  char c1, c2;
  c1 = c1 + c2;
  ----
  float f1, f2;
  f1 = f2 + 0.2;
  ```
- rearrangement for floating-point expression is often restrict because of precision
  ```c
  double x, y, z;
  x = (x * y) * z;        // != x *= y * z
  z = (x - y) + y;        // != z = x
  z = x + x * y;          // != z = x * (1 + y)
  y = x / 5.0;            // != y = x * 0.2
  ```
- on a machine which overflows produce an explicit trap, cannot rewrite expression even with associativity
  ```c
  int a, b;
  a = a + 32760 + b + 5;  // != a = a + b + 32760 + 5
  ```
- the order of execution of each operand is undefined
  ```c
  int sum;
  int *p;
  sum = sum + 10 + (*p++ = getchar()) // increment of p or getchar can occur at any point between previous and next sequence point
  ```
- trigraph sequences are replaced before any processing (usually need to enable via `-trigraphs`)
  ```c
  ??=define arraycheck(a, b) a??(b??) ??!??! b??(a??)
  â†“
  #define arraycheck(a, b) a[b] || b[a]
  ```
- digraphs contain `<: :> <% %> %: %:%:` behave, respectively, the same as `[ ] { } # ##` except for their spelling (when "stringized")

### Language

#### Concepts

- identifiers can belong to one of four scopes (function, file, block, and function prototype)
  - label name scope is only function scope
- only enumeration constant has scope right after its defining enumerator, others have scope after the completion of its declarator
  ```c
  enum state {
    PENDING = 0,
    FAILED = PENDING,     // can use `pending` right after
  };
  ```
- if an identifier with `extern` in the scope which already exist that identifier, identifier keep the prior linkage
  ```c
  static int i = 10;
  extern int i;           // i linkage is internal
  -----
  int i = 10;
  extern int i;           // i linkage is external
  ```
- an _automatic storage duration_ object (not VLA)'s lifetime from entry into the object (`goto` into the middle of the block) until execution of that block ends in anyway (`goto`). For VLA, its lifetime is available only if passing through the declaration
  ```c
  int main()
  {
    goto test;
    {
      int x = 1;
    test:
      printf("%d", x);    // work
    }
  }
  ```
- a non-lvalue expression with struct or union type, its member with array-type refer to an object which has temporary lifetime
  ```c
  struct X { char a[8]; };
  struct Y { char a; };
  struct X getX(void) {
    struct X result = { "world" };
    return result;
  }
  struct Y getY() {
    struct Y result = { 1 };
    return result;
  }
  int main() {
    char *i = getX().a;   // work
    char *j = &getY().a;  // not work
  }
  ```
- _scalar types_ = _arithmetic types_ + _pointer types_
  - _arithemetic types_ = _integer types_ + _floating types_
  - _integer types_ = char types + signed/unsigned integer types + enumerated types
  - _floating types_ = real floating types + complex types
- _trap representation_ don't present values of the object type and not applied for struct or union (even any of their members can be trap representation)
  for example, a C implementation take non {0, 1} values to be trap representation for `_Bool`
- most of the recent C compilers only support two's complement
- alignment of a struct object is the strictest (largest) alignment from its members and valid alignment values are a non-negative integral power of two

#### Expressions

- bitwise operators yield values depend on the internal representation of integers and have implementation-defined for signed bytes
- compound literal storage duration depends on where it occurs, static when outside of a function, automatic within the enclosing block
  ```c
    "/tmp/fileXXXXXX"                   // static no mater what and non-modifiable
    (char []){"/tmp/fileXXXXXX"}        // like compound literal storage above and modifiable
    (const char []){"/tmp/fileXXXXXX"}  // like above (except it can be placed in read-only memory and even be shared) and non-modifiable
    (const char []){"abc"} == "abc"     // might yield 1
  ```
- each compound literal creates only single object in a given scope (in iteration statement, it is initialized each time since each iteration has each own scope)
  ```c
  struct s { int i; };
  int main() {
    struct s q;
    int j = 0;
  again:
    q = (struct s){j++};
    if (j < 2)
      goto again;
    return q.i == 1;      // true
  }
  ```
- the result of unary operators `+`, `-` and `~` is the value of its (promoted) operand
  ```c
  char x;
  printf("%lu %lu", sizeof(x), sizeof(+x)); // 1 4
  ```
- the operands of `sizeof/alignof` operators are expressions that are not evaluated (except VLA for `sizeof`)
  ```c
  size_t n = sizeof(printf("%d", 4)); // doesn't output to terminal, n = 4
  ```
- in assignment expression, the evalution of operands (both left and right) are unsequenced, but updating stored value in left operand is sequenced after both
- `&` and `*` operators are canceled each other when apply to the same operand (no dereference is applied)
  ```c
  int a[10];
  int *p = &*NULL;        // p = NULL, work
  int *q = &a[2];         // q = a + 2
  ```

#### Declarations

- enumerated type is implemented-defined (char, signed or unsigned integer), is capable of representing values (an implementation may delay the choice of which integer type untils the type is completed)
- _qualifiers_ between `*` and the identifer qualify the type of the pointer
  ```c
  int n = 10;
  const int *p = &n;      // pointer to a const int
  *p = 10;                // invalid
  p = NULL;               // valid
  ----
  int * const p = &n;     // const pointer to a non-const int
  *p = 10;                // valid
  p = NULL;               // invalid
  ----
  int p[const] = &n;      // const array of a non-cost int
  ```
- objects of any variably-modified type may only be declared at block or function scope and must have automatic/allocated storage duration (except pointer to VLA)
  ```c
  int n = 10;
  int foo[n];             // invalid
  void func() {
    int baz[n];           // valid
    static int x[n];      // invalid
    extern int y[n];      // invalid
    static int (*z)[n];   // valid
  }
  ```
- l-value expressions designate objects and any members of those objects of const-qualified type are not modifiable lvalues (even re-assign with the same value)
  ```c
  struct { int a; const int b; } s1 = { .b = 1 }, s2 = { .b = 2 };
  s1 = s2; // valid
  ```
- if a object (array, struct/union) is declared with any combination of type qualifiers (`const`, `volatile` and `restrict`), its member types acquire those qualifiers
- struct/union doesn't create a new scope -> nested types, enumeration, which is introduced inside are visible to the surrounding scope
- zero with bit field is only allowed for nameless and specify the next bit field will begin at a next unit type
  ```c
  struct foo {
    int x: 1;
    int y: 2;
    int z: 3;
  } // sizeof(struct foo) == 4
  struct baz {
    int x: 1;
    int : 0;
    int z: 3;
  } // sizeof(struct baz) == 8
  ```
- `register/restrict` and `inline` (only for function) are the hint, a compiler is free to ignore it
- function declaration can appear at block scope as well as function scope (not like function definition <- usually compiler support block scope function definition but it is non-standard)
- for `static inline`, if there is no reference, the compiler can ignore that function in the resulting object file (each translation unit will have its definition of that function -> waste space). While `extern inline`, the compiler has to generate a global definition in the resulting object file (only one global definition). [`inline` alone can lead to confusing thing](https://blogs.oracle.com/d/inline-functions-in-c)
- an empty list in a function declaration means a function has an unspecified number of parameters, while an empty list in a function definition means a function has no parameters
  ```c
  int foo();
  int main() {
    foo(1);               // valid, without any warnings
  }
  int foo() {
    return 1;
  }
  ```
- `typedef` can be interpreted different based on contexts
  ```c
  typedef signed int t;
  typedef int plain;
  struct tag {
    unsigned t:4;         // is unsigned identifer t with 4-bit field
    const t:5;            // is unnamed const signed int 5-bit field
    plain r:5;            // is signed int identifer r with 5-bit field
  };
  ----
  t f(t (t));             // f is the function, returning signed int, with one unnamed parameter pointer (to function returning signed int with one unnamed parameter signed int)
  long t;                 // is long identifer t
  ```
- `typedef` denotes a variable length array type, the length of an array is fixed at the time `typedef` is defined
  ```c
  void copy(int n)
  {
    typedef int B[n];     // B is n ints, n evaluated now
    n += 1;
    B a;                  // a is n ints, n without += 1
    int b[n];             // a and b are different sizes
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++)
      a[i-1] = b[i];
  }
  ```
- in the initializer, if number of initialized elements exceed size array, compiler freely discard those
  ```c
  int p[2] = {1, 2, 3, 4}; // two last elements 3 and 4 are discard
  ```
- if the initializer of the subobject doesn't begin with a left brace, the subobject will take enough initializers from the list and left remaining initializers for the next element
  ```c
  struct foo
  {
  	int x, y, z;
  };
  int main()
  {
  	struct foo baz[] = {1, 2, 3, 4};          // baz[0] = { .x = 1, .y = 2, z = 3}, baz[1] = { .x = 4};
  	struct foo bar[] = {1, 2, {3, 4, 5}, 6};  // baz[0] = { .x = 1, .y = 2, z = 3}, baz[1] = { .x = 6};
    struct foo qux[] = {{1}, 2, 3};           // baz[0] = { .x = 1 }, baz[1] = { .x = 2, .y = 3};
  }
  ```
  ```c
  struct fred
  {
  	int a[3], b;
  } w[] = {[0].a = {1}, [1].a[0] = 2};
  ```
- you re-run the array index in initializer
  ```c
  int a[MAX] = {
    1, 3, 5, 7, 9, [MAX-5] = 8, 6, 4, 2, 0    // if MAX > 10, some zero-values element in the middle
                                              // if MAX < 10, some of values provided by the first 5 elments will be overrided
  };
  ```

#### Statements

- statements are not/don't include declarations
- if the first substatement is reached via a label, the second substatement is not executed
- jump into loop body cause the controlling expression of a `for` or `while` is not evaluated, nor _clause-1_ of a `for` statement
  ```c
  goto bump;
  ----
  for(int i = 0; i < 10 ; ++i) { // i is declared but `i = 0` and `i < 10` are not executed after jumping
    bump:
      printf("%d", i);
  }
  ----
  while(i < 0) {                  // `i < 0` is not executed after jumping
    bump:
      printf("%d", i);
  }
  ```
- `goto` statement is not allowed to jump past any declarations of VLA (jump within scope is permitted)
  ```c
  goto lab3; // invalid: going INTO scope of VLA.
  {
    double a[n];
    a[j] = 4.4;
  lab3:
    a[j] = 3.3;
    goto lab4; // valid: going WITHIN scope of VLA.
    a[j] = 5.5;
  lab4:
    a[j] = 6.6;
  }
  goto lab4; // invalid: going INTO scope of VLA.
  ```

#### External definitions

- "An identifier declared as a typedef name shall not be redeclared as a parameter"
  ```c
  typedef int foo;
  int baz(foo) int foo;   // invalid
  {
    return 1;
  }
  ```
- in the same scope, an identifier can be declared more than once (except identifier with no linkage) while the definition is only once

#### Preprocessing directives

- source file inclusion has 3 forms
  ```c
  #include <h-char-sequence> new-line
  #include "h-char-sequence" new-line     // if not supported for failed, continue with form-1
  #include pp-tokens new-line             // macro replacement if having
  ```
- `#` follows by an identifier, the identifier is not subject to macro replacement
- if any nested replacements encounter for the name of the macro being replaced, it is not replaced (or unspecified behavior)
- line control has 2 forms
  ```c
  #line digit-sequence "s-char-sequence"(opt) new-line
  #line pp-tokens new-line                // macro replacement if having
  ```
